# Elementary Telegram Bot on polling

"Long polling" periodically polls the telegram server, due to this the user will feel that the bot is "slowing down",
because there will be pauses between sending a message from the user and receiving a response. 

Webhook edition receives info from Telegram API. Yes, it looks faster but there are other cases to compare.
